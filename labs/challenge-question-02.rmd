# Hidden Bugs

Consider one solution to **open_goat_door()** from last week's lab. 

```{r}
open_goat_door <- function( game, a.pick )
{
   doors <- c(1,2,3)
   # if contestant selected car,
   # randomly select one of two goats 
   if( game[ a.pick ] == "car" )
   { 
     goat.doors <- doors[ game != "car" ] 
     opened.door <- sample( goat.doors, size=1 )
   }
   if( game[ a.pick ] == "goat" )
   { 
     opened.door <- doors[ game != "car" & doors != a.pick ] 
   }
   return( opened.door ) # number between 1 and 3
}
```


Note that we use an if-else structure to the code (or if-if as implemented here), to check what our initial selection is before returning the open door. 

Also note that the criteria is exactly the same no matter which scenario we are in - we can't open the door with the car, and we can't open the current pick. Why do we care if the current pick is the car? Why not create a more general solution that works for both cases? 

```{r, eval=F}
available.doors <- doors[ game != "car" & doors != a.pick ]
opened.door <- sample( available.doors, size=1 )
```

Note that we will always either have one or two doors available:

```{r}
doors <- 1:3

game <- c("goat","car","goat")
a.pick <- 1
doors[ game != "car" & doors != a.pick ]

game <- c("goat","car","goat")
a.pick <- 2
doors[ game != "car" & doors != a.pick ]

game <- c("goat","car","goat")
a.pick <- 3
doors[ game != "car" & doors != a.pick ]
```

Why does our function always work correctly when we first select the car?

```{r}
game <- c("goat","car","goat")
a.pick <- 2
available.doors <- doors[ game != "car" & doors != a.pick ]
# door 1 or 3 available

test.cases <- NULL
for( i in 1:10 )
{ 
   opened.door <- sample( available.doors, size=1 )
   test.cases <- c( test.cases, opened.door ) 
}

test.cases  # should be 1 or 3
```


But we end up with strange results when we first select a goat? 

```{r}
game <- c("goat","car","goat")
a.pick <- 1
available.doors <- doors[ game != "car" & doors != a.pick ]
# door 3 only available

test.cases <- NULL
for( i in 1:10 )
{ 
   opened.door <- sample( available.doors, size=1 )
   test.cases <- c( test.cases, opened.door ) 
}

test.cases  # should always be 3
```


This is a problem! Our function now violates all of the rules by sometimes opening Door 2 with the car behind it, and sometimes opening Door 1, our current selection. 

What is going on here???


## Bug Hunters


**Can anyone figure out the cause of this very subtle but very serious bug???**

I will tell you that the logic of the above functions is correct. 

Maybe look back to the stable solution that uses the if-else structure to test initial cases. Why would that fix the code? Which scenario appears to be problematic?
